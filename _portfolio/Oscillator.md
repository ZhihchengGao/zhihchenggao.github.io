**The Oscillator is my MYP Personal Project initiative.**

<br>

## **The Goals**

Learning Goal: I want to learn about the sciences behind music, and how it influences human emotion.

Product Goal: Create a music album with different pieces that are targeted to ease different emotions of humans.

<br>

## **Specifications of products**

### **The Musical Album:**
**Form**: The album must include at least 3 different music pieces with each one corresponding 
emotional state to be resolved. Each of the pieces should be at least 2 minutes long. The music is 
creative with high quality audio and effective implications. There could be different version of the 
same piece published for different needs (Theoretical, instrumental, just temperamental)

**Purpose**: The album’s priority goal is to act as a tool when people is having a severe emotional 
state, which the music piece help to resolve them. The piece might also have different version 
that focus on more of an entertaining or experimental side. 

**Audience**: Everyone. Everyone have their emotional hard time that can be cured by music. But 
this will be more effective with people who already have an interest on music.

**Impact**: A new way of dealing with the emotional world is offered to the public and my audience.

### **Educational Video:**

**Form**: Video. High-definition pictures, well designed scenes, information should be well conveyed 
visually and verbally. The Video should be at least 2 minutes.

**Purpose**: The video is a side product or a justification on my album. This video’s purpose is to 
introduce the other side, the factual side of how music works.

**Audience**: Everybody. Especially to those who already have a certain level of music 
understanding.

**Impact**: Gaining knowledge and a new perspective on music.

## **How is this project relevant to you?**

By the time I finish this project, all of the information (Musical program, source code, plannings, criteria, essays) will be published on this site. Other developers will have a change to actually use it for the future. If you are intersted in the project, please follow up on this website.

The album will also be published and actually form will be carved and printed. I will sell it on the PP Exibition and the money will go to charity.
