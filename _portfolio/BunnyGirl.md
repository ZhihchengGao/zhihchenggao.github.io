What does music meant to you?

Some say music is relif, some say music is catharsis, some say music is simply entertainment.

Metal music, for us, is our attitude, our faith. Instead of cry and be pressured and scared of what's surround us. We scream our desire and anger out though each breakdown in our brave thrash metal.

We make it or not does not matter. At least when we are old and numb, we will find some evidence of once we were young. We know that the metal spirit we raised, and our friendship, will last forever. 

***HAIL BUNNYGIRL!***
