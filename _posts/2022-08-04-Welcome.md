# A Note From Richard

Posted: Augest 4 2022, Tuesday

Welcome, to my newly estabilished personal website, by the time you're seeing it, it might not be new anymore.
 
 ## About Insanity

Like what you see in the front page, big bold text written 'Our insanity change the world'. 'Insanity' mentioned is definitly not meaning 'mentally ill', instead, it's my frank usage of word expressing 'innovation' 'rebellion' or even 'bravery'...well, these things seem appear to stubborn people as 'insanity'. These words surely lives in side my as well (why I would use insanity as the title otherwise). They live inside my soul as a mixture, a medley of emotion, so I decided to use 'Insanity' as the simple representation of it.

## What is this for, then?

Here, I will post and update about my **daily life, academic life, and my music career** either individually or with VARKS and BunnyGirl.

Be Well, thank you for finding this website.
